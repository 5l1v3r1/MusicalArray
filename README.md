# MusicalArray
Arduino project that creates tones at specified frequency, requires a piezo speaker and some electronic components as well

This project requires some hardware, including:
- Arduino microprocessor
- Piezo speaker or buzzer
- Some jumper wires

Recommended:
- A potentiometer (variable resistor) - this adjusts volume (or tone if you hook up a capacitor)
- If not, atleast a 1000k resistor will do to lower the volume
